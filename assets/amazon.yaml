    Amazon Titan FMs are a family of powerful, general-purpose models pretrained
    on large datasets. They initially offer two Titan models - Titan Text and Titan
    Embeddings. Titan Text is a generative LLM for tasks such as summarization,
    text generation, classification, open-ended Q&A, and information extraction.
    Titan Embeddings is an embeddings LLM that translates text inputs (words, phrases
    or possibly large units of text) into numerical representations (known as embeddings)
    that contain the semantic meaning of the text.

      "Titan FMs are built to detect and remove harmful content in the data, reject
      inappropriate content in the user input, and filter model outputs that contain
      inappropriate content (such as hate speech, profanity, and violence)."

    The models can be used as is or privately customized with the customer's own
    data for a particular task. They are intended for natural language tasks such
    as summarization, text generation, classification, open-ended Q&A, and information
    extraction, and also to enhance search accuracy and improve personalized recommendations
    using word embeddings.

      "None of the customer’s data is used to train the original base models, and
      since all data is encrypted and does not leave a customer’s Virtual Private
      Cloud (VPC), customers can trust that their data will remain private and confidential."
