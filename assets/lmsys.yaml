    value: 13B parameters (dense model)
    explanation: Available in 7B and 13B sizes.
  analysis:
    value: A preliminary evaluation of the model quality is conducted by creating
      a set of 80 diverse questions and utilizing GPT-4 to judge the model outputs.

    explanation: Vicuna's delta model weights are available on [[Hugging Face]](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-delta-v1.1).
      To obtain the actual Vicuna model, one must apply it on top of the original
      LLaMA weights (see [instructions](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat#vicuna-weights)).
      The training code is available on the [[GitHub repository]](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).
      An [[online demo]](https://chat.lmsys.org/) has also been made available.
      There is no plan to release the dataset.

  prohibited_uses:
    value: >
      Authors note the following limitations: "We have noticed that, similar to
      other large language models, Vicuna has certain limitations. For instance,
      it is not good at tasks involving reasoning or mathematics, and it may have
      limitations in accurately identifying itself or ensuring the factual accuracy
      of its outputs. Additionally, it has not been sufficiently optimized to guarantee
      safety or mitigate potential toxicity or bias."
    explanation: See [[Limitations]](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/#limitations)
